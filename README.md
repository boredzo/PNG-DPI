# PNG DPI
## A tool for setting the resolution metadata of any PNG image

This tool lets you set the pixels-per-real-world-space resolution of a PNG image in either DPI or pixels-per-centimeter (the PNG format uses pixels per meter), or by specifying the real-world size in inches or centimeters.

For example, two 1-pixel images are included, each of which is just under 8 inches by 10 inchesâ€”a little smaller than a sheet of US Letter paper. (At that resolution, the pixels-per-meter values, which must be integers, are 5 and 4, respectively. That's why it's not possible to make them exactly 8.5 by 11 inches.) These are pretty much the smallest sheet-sized image files possible.

Yes, it's possible to set the horizontal and vertical DPI settings to different values. No, I don't know of anything that displays such an image correctly.
